# Model Experiments Toolbox

**A collection of Python tools for model searching tasks and experiments in regression and classification problems.**

## Regression Tools

- Tester: a class that helps conduct experiments for a given model, data and set of features.
- KFoldCrossValidator: a class that helps to conduct k-folds cross validation experiments for a given model, data and set of features.
- LOOCrossValidator: a class that helps to conduct LOOCV experiments for a given model, data and set of features.
- Explorer: a class used to explore sets of regressors with various settings using cross validation.
- RandomizedSearchCrossValidator: a class that helps to cross validate a model with different features and randomized search for best hyperparameters.
- GridSearchCrossValidator: a class that helps to cross validate a model with different features and grid search for best hyperparameters.
